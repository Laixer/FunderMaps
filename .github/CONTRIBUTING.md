# How to contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion. 
Then we can decide if and how a feature or a change could be implemented and if you should submit a pull requests with code changes.

## Found and issue or a bug?
Please start a discussion on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Zanhos/FunderMaps/issues).

## Filing issues
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
2. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
3. Did you enable logging?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Contributing code and content
You will need to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA) before submitting your pull request. The first time you submit a PR, a bot will take you through that process.

Please make sure to include tests, that cover the changes/additions you made to the code base.

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.
